                    <p>Siphosethu - Pre-school and Creche is an Early Childhood Development Organization whose history defines a descerning period of commitment to purpose, perseverance and dedication expressed by itd founders. The rich history illustrates a steadfast interest by its fonders to provide developmental and learning programmeswhere children from birth to six years of age can grow and thrive physically, mentally, emotionally, morally and socially which is a required foundation for success in future learning for children in the defined groups.

                    <p>Established in the private residence in 1979, registered by the then Zulu Government dispensation, this early childhood development organization was then afforded premises to conduct its activities which were erected behimd Thokoza Shopping Complex. In there we were able to enroll more children within the age range of four months and above from the surrounding area, started providing day care service centre activities and began collecting monthly fees from the parents to cater for food for children, salaries for practitioners and other staff members and provided other related expenditure items.</p>

                    <p>Advertently, the relating of the historical overtures which describes as it were, fundamental aspects of the physical, emotional and intellectual contribution by the current Principal and the head of this Early Childhood Development facility evokes her demeanor and attributes to lead and develop this centre for children. During the formative years, Creches were governed by the Committee members referred to as the Mother Body then led by Mrs Khanye from 1979 until she retired resulting in the change of leadership and the appointment of Mrs Msibi as a Principal of the centre which appointment lasted only seven months. In 1986 the Mother Body decided to promote from within and chose one of the educators amongst the teachers, Mrs SG Mntambo, who stood out in terms of her passion for children and teaching skills as the new Principal of Siphosethu Creche. At the time the centre constituted an enrolment of 35 children and a staff of three practitiners who worked as educators. Immediately after her appointment changes occurred which included an increase in enrolment from 35 learners up to 100 learners prompting the school to employ three more teachers and a cooker for learners. The centre became popular in and around its community as a result parents were very impressed with the overall management and running of the centre.</p>

                    <p>Siphosethu, Pre-School and Creche developed very quickly and began to introduce modern approach to the development of children. In the midst of things the Department of Social Development beganintroducing various programmes that require formal and accreddited skills and educational development for practitioners in the fild of child rearing and formulated the concept of Early Childhood Development which required all practitioners to obtain training and skills development in prescribed curricula and programmes set by the department of Social Development. The centre provided the necessary opportunities for its practitioners and sent many of them to the ECD training programs to acquire relevant and accredited training which led to the centre attaining the growth rate of 201 learners in then year 2000.</p>
